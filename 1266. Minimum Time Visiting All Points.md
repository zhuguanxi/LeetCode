# 1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-01-12)

## Problem Description
On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.

You can move according to these rules:

* In 1 second, you can either:
* move vertically by one unit,
* move horizontally by one unit, or
* move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in 1 second).
* You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
* You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.

### WAY 1:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& p) {
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < p.size(); i++)
        {
            ans += max(abs(p[i][0] - p[i - 1][0]), abs(p[i][1] - p[i - 1][1]));
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
* N：points 的長度(1 <= n <= 100)
* Time Complexity $O(N)$
* Space Complexity $O(1)$
