## Problem Description
You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.


### WAY 1:
```
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        char ans = letters[0];
        for (int i=0; i<letters.size(); i++)
        {
            if (letters[i] > target)
            {
                ans = letters[i];
                break;
            }  
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
* N：letters 的長度 (2 <= letters.length <= 104)
* Time Complexity $O(N)$
* Space Complexity $O(1)$
