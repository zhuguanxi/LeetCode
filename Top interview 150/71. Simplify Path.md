## Problem Description
You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

* A single period '.' represents the current directory.
* A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
* Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
* Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.
The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

* The path must start with a single slash '/'.
* Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
* The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
* The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.
Return the simplified canonical path.

### WAY 1:
* Time Complexity O(2n) = O(n), n : path.size()
