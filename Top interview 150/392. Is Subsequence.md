## Promble Description
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

### WAY 1:
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        if (s.size() == 0 && t.size() == 0)
            return true;

        for (int i=0,j=0; i<t.size(); i++)
        {
            if (t[i] == s[j])
                j++;
            if (j == s.size())
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};

```
