## Promble Description
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

* Your solution must use only constant extra space.

### WAY 1:
* Time Complexity O(n), n : numbers.size()
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = numbers.size()-1;

        while (left < right)
        {
            int total_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

            if (total_sum == target)
                return {left+1, right+1};
            else if (total_sum < target)
                left++;
            else if (total_sum > target)
                right--;
        }
        return {-1, -1}; 
    }
};
