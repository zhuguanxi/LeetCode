## Problem Link
[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/apple-redistribution-into-boxes/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-12-24)

## Problem Description
You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.

There are n packs where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the ith box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.

Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.

Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.

### WAY 1:
* Time Complexity O(2n)=O(n), n : apple.size()
```
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumBoxes(vector<int>& apple, vector<int>& capacity) {
        sort(capacity.begin(),capacity.end(), std::greater<int>());
        int total_apple = 0;
        for (auto& x:apple)
            total_apple += x;
        int box = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<capacity.size(); i++)
        {
            if (total_apple > 0)
            {
                total_apple -= capacity[i];
                box ++;
            }
            else
                return box;
        }
        return box;
    }
};
```
