## Problem Description
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### WAY 1:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        vector<int> ans(n+1, 0);

        ans[0] = 1;
        ans[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++)
            ans[i] = ans[i-1] + ans[i-2];

        return ans[n];
    }
};
```
* N：1 <= n <= 45
* Time Complexity $O(N)$
* Space Complexity $O(N)$
