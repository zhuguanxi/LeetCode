# 11. Container With Most Water

## Problem Link
[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

## Problem Description
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container

### WAY 1:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int max_contain = 0;

        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size()-1;

        while (left < right)
        {
            int tmp = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right]);
            max_contain = max(max_contain, tmp);

            if (height[left] < height[right])
                left ++;
            else
                right --;
        }

        return max_contain;
    }
};

* N：vector height 的長度(2 <= n <= 105)
* Time Complexity $O(N)$
* Space Complexity $O(1)$
